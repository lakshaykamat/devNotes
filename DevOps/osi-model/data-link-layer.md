## Data Link Layer
The data link layer is the second layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, responsible for reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication between devices on the same network. It ensures error-free data transmission, organizes bits into frames, performs error detection, and manages access to the physical medium through techniques like MAC (Media Access Control) addressing.

### Functions of data link layer
1. Frames data for reliable transmission between devices.
2. Performs error detection to ensure data integrity.
3. Manages access to the physical medium through MAC addressing.
4. Establishes and terminates links between devices.
5. Handles flow control to prevent data congestion.
6. Provides a mechanism for addressing and identifying devices on the same network.
