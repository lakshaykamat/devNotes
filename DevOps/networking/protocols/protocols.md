# Protocols
Protocols are sets of rules governing communication between devices or applications in computing. Examples include HTTP for web browsing and TCP/IP for network communication. They ensure standardized data exchange, facilitating interoperability and secure interactions in various domains such as networking, security, and file transfer.

## TCP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational communication protocol in computer networks. It ensures reliable data delivery by breaking information into packets, establishing connections, and confirming successful receipt. 
Widely used for internet communication, TCP enables error-free and ordered data transmission between devices, ensuring seamless data exchange.

## UDP
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight communication protocol in computer networks. Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't guarantee reliable or ordered data delivery but offers faster, connectionless transmission. Often used for real-time applications like video streaming and online gaming, UDP excels in scenarios prioritizing speed over absolute data integrity.

## HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, allowing browsers to request and display web pages. HTTP operates as a stateless protocol, enabling the transfer of text, images, files, and other content between servers and clients.
