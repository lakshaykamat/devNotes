# System Design
## Introduction
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and planning how different parts of the system will work together to achieve the desired functionality, scalability, reliability, and performance. 

In simple terms, it's like creating a blueprint for building a large, efficient, and robust software application.

Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple table that compares horizontal scaling and vertical scaling:

| **Feature**              | **Horizontal Scaling**                               | **Vertical Scaling**                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Adding more machines/servers to the existing system. | Increasing the capacity of a single machine/server. |
| **Other Names**          | Scale out                                            | Scale up                                            |
| **Resource Addition**    | More servers/computers                                | More CPU, RAM, storage to one server               |
| **Complexity**           | More complex; involves load balancing and distribution| Simpler; involves upgrading the existing server    |
| **Cost**                 | Can be more cost-effective in the long run            | Can be expensive; hardware upgrades can be costly  |
| **Performance Impact**   | Can handle more requests and larger loads             | Limited by the maximum capacity of the server      |
| **Fault Tolerance**      | Higher; failure of one server doesn't affect others   | Lower; single point of failure                     |
| **Maintenance**          | Can be more challenging; involves managing multiple systems | Simpler; involves maintaining one powerful machine|
| **Example Use Case**     | Web applications with high traffic (e.g., social media) | Smaller applications or initial stages of growth   |
