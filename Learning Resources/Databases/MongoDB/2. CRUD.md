# Basic CRUD Operations in MongoDB

CRUD operations are the foundational operations used in interacting with a database. In MongoDB, CRUD stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**. These operations allow you to manage and manipulate data within your MongoDB collections.

## 1. Create Operation (`insert`)
The **Create** operation is used to insert documents into a collection. In MongoDB, you can insert a single document or multiple documents at once.

### Insert a Single Document
To insert a single document into a collection, use the `insertOne()` method.

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 29,
  email: "john.doe@example.com"
});
```

### Insert Multiple Documents
To insert multiple documents at once, use the `insertMany()` method.

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    email: "alice@example.com"
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 32,
    email: "bob@example.com"
  }
]);
```

### Response
The response from an insert operation typically includes:
- **`insertedId`**: The unique ID assigned to the inserted document.
- **`acknowledged`**: A boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

## 2. Read Operation (`find`)
The **Read** operation is used to query documents from a collection. You can retrieve all documents, filter by specific criteria, or project only certain fields.

### Retrieve All Documents
To retrieve all documents from a collection, use the `find()` method.

```javascript
db.collectionName.find();
```

### Filter Documents
To filter documents based on specific criteria, pass a query object to the `find()` method.

```javascript
db.collectionName.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```
- The example above retrieves all documents where the `age` field is greater than 25.

### Project Specific Fields
You can project (select) specific fields to include or exclude in the returned documents using the second parameter in `find()`.

```javascript
db.collectionName.find(
  { age: { $gt: 25 } }, 
  { name: 1, email: 1, _id: 0 }
);
```
- This query returns only the `name` and `email` fields, excluding the `_id` field.

### Find a Single Document
To retrieve a single document that matches a query, use `findOne()`.

```javascript
db.collectionName.findOne({ email: "john.doe@example.com" });
```

## 3. Update Operation (`update`)
The **Update** operation is used to modify existing documents in a collection. You can update a single document or multiple documents.

### Update a Single Document
To update a single document, use the `updateOne()` method.

```javascript
db.collectionName.updateOne(
  { email: "john.doe@example.com" },
  { $set: { age: 30 } }
);
```
- The `$set` operator updates the `age` field to 30.

### Update Multiple Documents
To update multiple documents that match a filter, use `updateMany()`.

```javascript
db.collectionName.updateMany(
  { age: { $lt: 30 } },
  { $set: { status: "Active" } }
);
```
- This query updates the `status` field to "Active" for all documents where the `age` is less than 30.

### Upsert Operation
The `upsert` option creates a new document if no document matches the filter.

```javascript
db.collectionName.updateOne(
  { email: "new.user@example.com" },
  { $set: { name: "New User", age: 22 } },
  { upsert: true }
);
```

## 4. Delete Operation (`delete`)
The **Delete** operation is used to remove documents from a collection. You can delete a single document or multiple documents.

### Delete a Single Document
To delete a single document that matches a filter, use `deleteOne()`.

```javascript
db.collectionName.deleteOne({ email: "john.doe@example.com" });
```

### Delete Multiple Documents
To delete multiple documents that match a filter, use `deleteMany()`.

```javascript
db.collectionName.deleteMany({ status: "Inactive" });
```

### Drop a Collection
To remove all documents in a collection or delete the entire collection, you can use `drop()`.

```javascript
db.collectionName.drop();
```

## Conclusion
These CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—are the essential functions for managing data within MongoDB. Understanding and mastering these operations will provide a strong foundation for working with MongoDB in your applications.

Each of these operations can be further extended with additional options, operators, and methods to handle more complex use cases, such as working with embedded documents, arrays, and aggregations.
