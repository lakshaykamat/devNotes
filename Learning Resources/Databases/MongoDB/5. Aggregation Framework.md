# Aggregation Framework in MongoDB

The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool used for processing and analyzing data within collections. It allows for complex data transformations, computations, and querying through a series of stages, each performing a specific operation.

## Key Concepts

### Pipeline
- An **Aggregation Pipeline** consists of multiple stages through which documents pass sequentially.
- Each stage performs a specific operation on the data and passes the results to the next stage.
- The final output is the result after all stages have been applied.

### Stages
- **$match**: Filters documents based on specified criteria (similar to `find()`).
- **$group**: Groups documents by a specified key and performs aggregation operations (e.g., sum, average).
- **$project**: Reshapes documents by including, excluding, or computing new fields.
- **$sort**: Sorts documents based on specified fields.
- **$limit**: Restricts the number of documents in the output.
- **$skip**: Skips a specified number of documents.
- **$unwind**: Deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element.
- **$lookup**: Performs a left outer join to another collection, adding fields from the joined documents.

## Basic Aggregation Example

```javascript
db.collectionName.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "Active" } },           // Filters for active documents
  { $group: { _id: "$category", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }, // Groups by category and sums the amounts
  { $sort: { total: -1 } }                    // Sorts the results by total in descending order
]);
```

### Explanation:
1. **$match**: Filters documents where the `status` is "Active".
2. **$group**: Groups the documents by `category` and calculates the total `amount` for each group.
3. **$sort**: Sorts the grouped results by the `total` field in descending order.

## Common Aggregation Stages

### 1. **$match**
   - Filters documents that pass through the pipeline.
   - Similar to a `find()` operation but more efficient when used in an aggregation pipeline.

   ```javascript
   { $match: { status: "Active", age: { $gt: 18 } } }
   ```

### 2. **$group**
   - Groups documents by a specified key and applies aggregation expressions to each group.
   - Common operators include `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, and `$push`.

   ```javascript
   { $group: { _id: "$category", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" }, avgSales: { $avg: "$amount" } } }
   ```

### 3. **$project**
   - Reshapes each document, including or excluding fields, or adding new computed fields.
   - Can also be used to rename fields or apply transformations.

   ```javascript
   { $project: { name: 1, age: 1, isAdult: { $gte: ["$age", 18] } } }
   ```

### 4. **$sort**
   - Sorts documents based on one or more fields in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order.

   ```javascript
   { $sort: { totalSales: -1, name: 1 } }
   ```

### 5. **$limit**
   - Limits the number of documents passing through the pipeline.

   ```javascript
   { $limit: 5 }
   ```

### 6. **$skip**
   - Skips a specified number of documents in the pipeline.

   ```javascript
   { $skip: 10 }
   ```

### 7. **$unwind**
   - Deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element of the array.

   ```javascript
   { $unwind: "$tags" }
   ```

### 8. **$lookup**
   - Performs a left outer join with another collection to include related data.

   ```javascript
   {
     $lookup: {
       from: "orders",
       localField: "_id",
       foreignField: "customerId",
       as: "customerOrders"
     }
   }
   ```

## Advanced Aggregation Examples

### Calculating Total Sales per Customer

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $lookup: {
       from: "customers",
       localField: "_id",
       foreignField: "_id",
       as: "customerDetails"
     }
  },
  { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } }
]);
```

### Using `$unwind` and `$group` Together

```javascript
db.blogPosts.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$tags" },                      // Unwind the tags array
  { $group: { _id: "$tags", count: { $sum: 1 } } }, // Count occurrences of each tag
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }                   // Sort by count in descending order
]);
```

### Aggregation with Date Operations

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { orderDate: { $gte: ISODate("2024-01-01") } } },
  { $group: {
      _id: { month: { $month: "$orderDate" }, year: { $year: "$orderDate" } },
      totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" },
      averageSales: { $avg: "$amount" }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { "_id.year": 1, "_id.month": 1 } }
]);
```

## Aggregation Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
- **$add**: Adds numbers.
- **$subtract**: Subtracts numbers.
- **$multiply**: Multiplies numbers.
- **$divide**: Divides numbers.
- **$mod**: Returns the remainder of division.

### Array Operators
- **$arrayElemAt**: Returns the element at the specified array index.
- **$concatArrays**: Concatenates arrays into a single array.
- **$filter**: Selects a subset of the array.

### String Operators
- **$concat**: Concatenates strings.
- **$substr**: Extracts a substring.
- **$toUpper**: Converts a string to uppercase.
- **$toLower**: Converts a string to lowercase.

### Conditional Operators
- **$cond**: A ternary operator (if-else).
- **$ifNull**: Returns a value if a field is null or missing.

## Performance Considerations
- **Indexes**: Use indexes to optimize `$match` and `$sort` operations.
- **Pipeline Design**: Minimize the number of documents passing through the pipeline by using `$match` and `$limit` early.
- **Memory**: Aggregations are memory-intensive; be mindful of large datasets.

## Conclusion
The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allows for complex data manipulations and computations. By chaining multiple stages in a pipeline, you can transform, filter, and analyze your data in various ways, making it an essential tool for working with MongoDB.

As you grow more familiar with the Aggregation Framework, you can start combining stages and operators to perform increasingly sophisticated queries and transformations on your data.
