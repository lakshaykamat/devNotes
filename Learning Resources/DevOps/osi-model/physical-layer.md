## Physical Layer
The physical layer is like the concrete foundation of a buildingâ€”it deals with the actual hardware and wires that let devices connect to each other, making sure they can send and receive signals over the network.

### Functions Of Physical layer
1. Transmits and receives raw data bits over a physical medium.
2. Defines cable types, connectors, and signaling methods.
3. Specifies network topology and interface characteristics.
4. Determines bit rate, bandwidth, and transmission modes.
5. Handles physical addressing (e.g., MAC addresses).
6. May include basic error detection mechanisms.
7. Serves as the foundation for higher OSI layers in communication systems.
