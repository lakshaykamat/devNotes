Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. Here's a breakdown:

- **Focus on data:** Machine learning algorithms are trained on large amounts of data. This data can be anything from text and images to numbers and sound. By analyzing the data, the algorithms can identify patterns and relationships.
    
- **Making predictions:** Once trained, machine learning models can make predictions on new data. For instance, a model trained on email data can filter spam emails, or a model trained on customer purchases can recommend new products.
    
- **Learning and improving:** Machine learning models can continue to learn and improve over time as they are exposed to more data. This is what makes them different from traditional programming, where the code is set and doesn't change.
    

There are different types of machine learning, but some common ones include:

- **Supervised learning:** In this type of learning, the data is labeled with the desired outcome. For example, a spam filter might be trained on emails that have been labeled as spam or not spam.
    
- **Unsupervised learning:** In this type of learning, the data is not labeled. The algorithm must identify patterns in the data on its own. For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm might be used to group customers into different segments based on their purchasing habits.


Both regression and classification are fundamental tasks in machine learning, but they deal with different kinds of predictions:

**Regression:**

- **Focuses on continuous values:** Predicts a continuous numerical value, like price, temperature, or amount of rainfall.
- **Example:** A machine learning model trained on historical house prices and features like size, location, and number of bedrooms could use regression to predict the price of a new house.
- **Goal:** Find the best-fit line or curve that minimizes the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

**Classification:**

- **Focuses on discrete categories:** Predicts a discrete label or category, like spam/not spam, cat/dog, or tumor/healthy tissue.
- **Example:** An email filtering system might use classification to categorize an incoming email as spam or not spam based on the content of the email.
- **Goal:** Develop a decision boundary that accurately separates the data points into their respective categories.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

|Feature|Regression|Classification|
|---|---|---|
|Output type|Continuous numerical value|Discrete categories|
|Examples|Price prediction, temperature|Spam detection, image recognition|
|Goal|Best-fit line/curve|Decision boundary separation|
