Nowadays, my life has changed, and I am under a lot of pressure to earn money. Despite acquiring many skills throughout my life, sacrificing everything, I can't find a single job that pays off.

My dad doesn't have enough money to cover my college and traveling expenses, and I don't want to ask him for that.

Both my mom and dad are not well, but they are still working.

I have planned to stay at home, not go to college daily, and look for a job or study for academics. Today, I also received a call from a company in Janakpuri, and I hope I'll be placed in it.
