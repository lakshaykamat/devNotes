I need to earn money. That's final. But the question is how? Why would someone pay me? Maybe web development; there's too much competition. I have to earn money in Android development and create a career in Artificial Intelligence.

I will not go to college starting from Monday. My dad has no money, and I don't think I'll have more than 75% attendance, irrespective of whether I go to college daily.

But the question is, what will I do at home? One benefit is no traveling expenses, and the second will be more 'me' time for my career, leading to more income. For part-time income, I'll join my sister in freelancing.
