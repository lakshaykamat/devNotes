I'm unsure if my decision not to go to college is a good one or not. I've been searching for a job since December. I don't know what Ruchi Dad's reply to my resume will be; I hope I get selected in this companyâ€”my final hope.

Apart from this, Rohit's sales work is also understandable to me.

Unfortunately, I got rejected from Ruchi Dad's company, which was a source of high hopes for me. Rohit has gone for an interview today, and although I didn't ask him, he explained his success story. He may soon get selected for a 10-15 k job.

Here I am, highly skilled and having sacrificed everything, yet I haven't secured a single penny job. On the other hand, my sister's data entry work resulted in a meeting invitation. However, I'm not happy about this as, after a full day of work, I only earned 3-4 k.
