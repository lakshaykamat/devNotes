Today, I got a project idea for a Taylor Swift website with quizzes as the main focus. Over time, we plan to add more functionality such as news, announcements, badges, and a ranking system, among other ideas.

I discussed the idea with Ruchi, a verified Swiftie, and Chitransh Verma. I received positive feedback, and they expressed a commitment to moving forward together. I'm happy, and it seems like this time we will be working together.
