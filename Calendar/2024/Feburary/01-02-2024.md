One month has passed; January is over. Many things happened this month, but unfortunately, I was unable to look for a source of income. Sadly, Dad wasn't in the mood to provide me with travel expenses. Both Mom and Dad are unwell, so I have to take the lead in this situation, but the question remains: where to find money? Internships and data entry seem to be my last options.
