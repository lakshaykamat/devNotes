I'm doing great in my life; that's what I think. I am planning to do various things at once, like Android development, DSA, DevOps, and now thinking about a new thing: C#.

I want to create some games and desktop applications. I will add this to my learning journey. Until I'm a student, I have no major pressure of a job and earning money, so I can explore my interests.

And sometimes in a day, Ruchi comes to my mind. Of course, it's the 4th day of our *friendship breakup* (I can say this). I think that I have to go and be her friend again. That's what my emotions say. But if I think rationally, I didn't see any major benefits from her. **She just covers my loneliness, nothing else.** On the other hand, I am very beneficial to her. I teach and fix her bugs in code, and I don't think she is lonely. Every time, girls have someone that listens to them. If I went to her again, that means I have no self-respect.

> **It's just a matter of time; sooner or later, I'll forget her.**
