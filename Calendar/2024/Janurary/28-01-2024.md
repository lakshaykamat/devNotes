I woke up very late, around 11. Initially, I had woken up at 8, but since I had nothing to do at that moment, I went back to sleep. Now, I'm feeling confused about what to do with my life.

I sent a reel to Ruchi, and she replied, "You're back here; everything seems normal to me now. But let's see how things go apart."

I'm little bit distracted about my monk journey that i started on mid Jan, Its 27 Jan now and, I installed Instagram today and had a screen time of 1 h 50 min on that app but I'm doing good in other aspects

I want to improve my relations and me myself
