I submitted the project to the internship HR or whoever is in charge, and I hope they see it and reply. I worked really hard on this, and I also have a life. I want to enjoy things and take things lightly.

I'm thinking about starting React Native this year; it will help my career.

also I'm struggling with my bad habits 
- bad sleep schedule
- porn
- no bath
