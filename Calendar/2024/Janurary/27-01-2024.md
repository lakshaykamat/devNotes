I told Ruchi about my mental health. I don't think she'll believe me, but it's okay if she needs distance; I'm fine with that.

Apart from that, Anamika wants to meet me. She is crying and willing to do anything for that.

> It's strange how one person doesn't even talk to me when I'm close or ask about distancing, and the other is dying to meet me.
