The conversation I had with Ruchi last night was quite lengthy. She asked me, "When did I find her attractive as a girl?" I had a feeling she might ask that question someday, so I gave her a completely honest answer that I find certain things about her appealing. ^dd101d

I have many questions for her too, but I'm waiting for the right moment to ask and to get the right answer from her. Right now, I'm not ready for a relationship and I'm uncertain about where it might lead. Additionally, she mentioned that she isn't affected by comments about her outer beauty; she's used to it now.
