I am feeling troubled because nobody talks to me nicely in my house due to the fact that I have no money. Everybody insists that I, Lakshay, need to earn money, but I desire some time to think or plan certain things.

Everyone keeps pressuring me daily to do something. My mom and dad don't treat me well or respect me, which is why I remain quiet at home most of the time. I feel more comfortable and relaxed when no one is at home; I feel happy then. However, when my mom is around, she constantly complains about me, and I am too tired to listen to all of it.

I am trying to figure out sources of income that I want, but my exams are approaching, and I can't take more risks with that. I don't have any money, so I go to college, but I don't want to ask my parents for it because they dislike it.
