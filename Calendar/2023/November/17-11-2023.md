Today, I confided in Ruchi and Chitransh Verma about my suicidal thoughts and the incident involving poison. They seemed a bit shocked that, at such a young age (8th standard), I had consumed poison (Good Night, the mosquito killer). Reflecting on it myself, I realize it was a foolish move on my part. Haha!


Another sad thing got at night I saw reel about a realtionship that says realtionship could not be perfect so don't try to make perfect.
So like that I want to share with this ruchi but I was thinking that she will mean something else about me but I shared anyway and now she just ingnored that reel and responded on another 
reel she mean this real something else but but  ^7c74ce

This night, I saw a relationship reel that mentioned how relationships can't be perfect, suggesting not to strive for perfection. I wanted to share this insight with Ruchi, but I was worried she might misunderstand my intention. Despite my concerns, I shared it with her. ^cc7c98

However, she ignored that reel and responded to another one, possibly interpreting it differently. Now, I'm also ignoring her text messages, and it hurts. If she misunderstood me, she should communicate or tell me if something's wrong. Instead, she's choosing to ignore and avoid addressing the issue. It's disheartening to see where things stand.
