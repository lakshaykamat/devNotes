Every day, everyone reminds me that I'm not earning. 

Today, I asked my sister to give me some 'gajak' that she was eating. She replied, saying that I didn't give her money in the evening for the bread that I cooked for her.

**It hurts.** 

Yesterday, I bought Maggi, and I didn't even mention it, but she did.
