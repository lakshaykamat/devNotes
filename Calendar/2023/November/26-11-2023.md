My parents think that **_I'm rude, arrogant, and the worst child to them._**

_They believe I don't know how to talk, walk, sit, eat, or handle anything else._

_They also think **I don't know what is good or bad for me.**_

> _If I'm quiet, it doesn't mean I'm the worst; I simply don't want to talk because my words seem wasted on you._

I'm just waiting for my exams to end on December 14th. Then, I will start finding ways to **_earn money or actually make money_** and gain confidence at home.
