Today, I confessed the entire puja concept or drama to Ruchi. I'm unsure of what she might think; perhaps she'll just listen and eventually forget about it. However, today I stumbled upon Ruchi's journal. I know it's illegal, but I couldn't resist reading it. In her entries, she talks about her difficult relationships with her parents and friends. What caught my attention the most was her mention of meâ€”she wrote that she doesn't have feelings for me, and I need to accept that.

In the past few days, I've been realizing that my feelings for Ruchi might have just been an attraction, nothing deeper. Now, I'm contemplating confessing this to her, but I'm unsure of how she might react. She might not believe me or react differently. I'm starting to question why I need to keep up this charade when we could just be friends. She's an amazing person, and I don't understand why she doesn't have many friends.

> Tomorrow might be a bad day for me or for her. I hope she understands me and doesn't leave.
