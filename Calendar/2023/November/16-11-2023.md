I have a question in my mind: why do people prefer open-source apps over private apps that don't share the source code? On various YouTube channels and comment sections, everyone is showcasing the open-source apps they've been using for years, while overlooking other apps. For example, a user might prefer an app like Appflowy, which is an alternative to Notion, even though they essentially offer the same features. Notion is widely popular and has a vast community. ^56f4dd

I'm really close to Anshuman. Whenever we meet, we have a great time, joking around without any awkwardness, even on stage. But when I'm with Nikhil, all we talk about is how boring our college is and exams. I'm confused about this difference. ^c5a631

Today, once again, my mom and dad asked if there's any freelance work or other means for me to earn money. They ask this daily, and I feel uncomfortable with these repetitive questions. When I mentioned to my dad that I'll be going to college tomorrow, he immediately inquired about my freelance work. It feels like they expect me to find something even though I'm studying for my upcoming exams. They might think I'm uninterested because they provide financial support, but I'm genuinely trying my best amidst my academic commitments.
