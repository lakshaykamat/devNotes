Today was a turning point. Ruchi and I resolved everything between us. I made an early morning call around 9 o'clock and patiently waited for her response. When she did call back, I took the opportunity to explain the situation and offered my apologies, recognizing where I went wrong.

During our conversation, she advised me not to argue or dwell on things when she's in a bad mood. I realized I shouldn't let anything affect me to an extent that it ruins my day. Sometimes, it's best to simply let things go. ðŸ˜Œ ^8c42c7

She also became a little frustrated with Chitransh Verma. She mentioned that he has been bothering her for the past few days by repeatedly replying with the same usual responses whenever she communicates. Yesterday, she responded to him in anger, telling him not to talk to her like that and to keep his mouth shut.

Today, amidst everything, it's Chhath Puja. Unfortunately, my nani isn't celebrating this time due to her age and health. I miss my relatives dearly, especially on such occasions - my mausi, mama, mami, and their daughter. Everything seems brighter when we're all together. Sadly, we missed meeting during Diwali too. Here's hoping for a reunion soon. ðŸŒŸðŸŒº
