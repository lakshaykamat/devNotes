in a marriage the girl side has some people 10-15 but from men side are not much this marriage is terrible from groom and bride pov 

Today, Anamika confessed her love to me. I'm not shocked, but I'm not happy either. She is an awesome girl, but we haven't met each other yet. 

How can she love or have feelings if she doesn't know me well? It seems delusional to me. I feel sad for her, but *I seriously don't need any more drama in my life.* I have my goals, and 

> I need a focused or genuine partnerâ€”or nothing at all, that's it.

I had a call with Anamika. Although she is a really nice girl, **I'm not interested in anyone**, including her. She is a rare chick, but I have a fear of losing her, which is why I'm not showing any interest or playing along. I asked her why she has feelings for me, and she replied that she likes the way I listen and talk. I tried to convince her that I'm not going anywhere, that I'm here for her, and encouraged her to focus on her studies.
