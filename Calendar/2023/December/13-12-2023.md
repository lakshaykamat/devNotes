I have a lot to handle in my lifeâ€”earning money, taking care of my parents, and building a good relationship with a partner, which I need to find.

Tomorrow, my exams will be finished, and I have to start an internship. I won't be going to college with my dad money now because they didn't provide support, and I also feel uncomfortable about it.

Tomorrow, I'm meeting Ruchi for the last time, and I'm unsure when we'll meet again. She's an amazing girl and my best friend. I feel guilty for hurting her many times with my mistakes.

My parents, especially my dad, are not proud of me because I haven't accomplished much. However, I believe I'm more goal-oriented than other kids. Will this only change when I make money?

So, from tomorrow, I should pay attention to some things like personal care and career goals.

**In personal care:** Meditation, working out, early morning wake-up.

**In career goals:** Preparation for React interviews, fixing the portfolio.
