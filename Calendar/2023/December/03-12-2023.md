I have to stop all time waste and procrastination in my waste.

I don't know what to do in breaks or free times

I will STUDY NOW LIKE BEAST

I procrastinate all things without a plan so here the plan for this night

I have to earn money everyone here making me feel like an asshole. 

My dad not directly say to me that you have to earn money or pay your own expenses he say via my mom and then mom tell me in her way that I have to earn money nobody seeing that my exams are in progress I'm already stressed and don't have any other time

> I will do something after my exams or not go to college by dad's money


And what to do with anamika I'm playing with her feelings I think
I don't have genuine feelings for her so why to proceed further with this friendship cum relationship scenario
Or if she meet me she will lose all her feeling I'm sure beacuse I don't talk like this everytime it's only in the some peaceful scenario

And genuinely saying I have more feelings for ruchi rather than anamika
_I don't why but this is true_

I have some family responsibilities I don't have time for any of this two girl right now
I have to immediately earn money to pay my expenses.
Parents are only paying for food. Which is not bad

I not bad, someday I have to earn so why not NOW
