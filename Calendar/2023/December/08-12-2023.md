Today, I had an exam on algebra and calculus (Semester 1), and it didn't go well. 

However, there's another issue that's bothering me even more â€“ Ruchi. 

I feel that being friends with Ruchi is like banging my head against a wall; it hurts me but doesn't affect the wall. 

Despite my efforts, we haven't developed a strong friendship. I'm tired of trying as she only refers to me as a good friend, yet her actions suggest otherwise.

I'm considering distancing myself from her because things aren't progressing; I feel stuck. 

I've put in a lot of effort for her, but she takes me for granted. If I treated someone else the way I've treated her, I'm sure they would value me. 

I'm not stressed about her actions; I'm stressed about why I'm still here. 

She deserve to be alone with no real friends. I'm not alone or lonely; I have other, better options as well.
