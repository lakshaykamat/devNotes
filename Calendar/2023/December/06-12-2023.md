Today, I received a reply regarding my submitted application for an internship at Made2Automate. I have exams until December 14th, but I am very eager to join the internship after my exams.

I am genuinely interested in securing this internship, and Asad, despite facing adversity, also shares the same enthusiasm to join. I'm wondering if there's an opportunity for any of us—Ruchi, Asad, or myself—to be part of this internship.

Tomorrow, I plan to encourage them to apply, even if they might be considered underqualified initially. I strongly believe that they can learn and adapt as they go along in the role.
