It seems like today is tough for me and Ruchi due to a fight we had yesterday. The argument stemmed from my feeling that "I don't feel like I'm your friend based on your actions, even though you claim that you are my only friend."

This statement has made things quite dark between us. She is crying and chatting on WhatsApp because of this. She mentioned that she also feels like a waste to me, as every time I address this, I only handle her drama and nothing else.

I feel sorry for this. I won't do this from now on.

She said that everything is my fault and suggested breaking off this friendship.

> "I will win her back."
