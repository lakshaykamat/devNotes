I think I need to improve my physical appearance, overall hygiene, and actual fitness.

Today, Chitransh advised me to 'bathe daily' because some waste from my ears gets stuck when I wear earbuds.

I have to go long way of struggle they are many areas of life I have to improve specially the social one. I'm bad with girls I attached too soon. Someday I think I still likes her but then second thought comes that no way lakshay she is not that beautiful or what she have to offer in a relationship

She is a bad choice I will regret later, so prevention is better than cure and plus no man actually respects her

I don't have that lower standards to date that girl

I just wait for the right partner, who actually loves me
