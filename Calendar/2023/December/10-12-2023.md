I'm feeling I should ask Ruchi why she didn't reply. What happened? But I guess everything is alright; 

I'm just having a small guilt about possibly hurting her. Maybe she's enjoying her day. 

If she were truly my best friend, she would reach out to me. What kind of friend is she if she doesn't know anything about my likes and dislikes?
