Today might be a turning point in our so-called friendship with Ruchi.

I told her, "You are the problem in my life; please go. Mujhe chhod de, mera ho gaya, I'm done." She hasn't replied yet.

Her lack of response might be due to her ego. Her ego tends to sabotage all her relationships. I feel free now.

I was the one always protecting and being the guardian of our friendship, but it's over now. I'm the one who broke the glass.

Why do I always feel like I'm forcing this on her? She hasn't done anything for me. I've put in so much effort for her. This isn't a relationship; I'm not in love with her. So, why are things turning out this way? It's been a one-sided friendship. She doesn't know anything about how friendships work or how to show gratitude and value for the other person.

She took me for granted, but now it's over.

I wasted all my time on her, hoping for some basic treatment of being friends.

If I had given this time to my other friends, someone else would have appreciated me immensely. Yet, this also erased my fingerprints from her phone.
