Today, I partially lost my earbuds. I accidentally took them into the examination hall and handed them to the teacher. However, I forgot to collect the earbuds from the teacher.

Coincidentally, the teacher is from our college. When the teacher returned to the college, I called them and he mentioned that the earbuds are with with me.
