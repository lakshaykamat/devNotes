## Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is the sixth layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, focused on translating, encrypting, and formatting data to ensure that information exchanged between applications on different devices is understood and can be properly interpreted. It deals with the syntax and semantics of data, providing a common language for diverse systems.

### Functions of Presentation layer
1. Translates data between different systems for compatibility.
2. Encrypts and compresses data for security and efficient transmission.
3. Converts character sets and encoding formats for consistent representation.
4. Ensures syntax and semantics recognition for proper data interpretation.
5. Formats data for presentation to the application layer in a usable form.
6. Converts data formats between different network protocols for seamless communication.
