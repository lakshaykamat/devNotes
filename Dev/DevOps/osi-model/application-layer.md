## Application Layer
The application layer is the seventh and topmost layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, serving as the interface between the network and the end-user applications. It enables communication between software applications on different devices and provides network services directly to the user.

### Function of Application Layer
1. Provides network services directly to user applications.
2. Offers a user interface for end-users to interact with network applications.
3. Defines specific application protocols for different types of communication.
4. Manages data exchange and controls dialog between applications.
5. Supports file transfer, access, and management between devices.
6. Facilitates email communication through protocols like SMTP.
7. Enables remote access and management of files on different devices.
