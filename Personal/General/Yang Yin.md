# Yang and Yin
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Yin_and_Yang_symbol.svg/1200px-Yin_and_Yang_symbol.svg.png)
- **Yang:** This is the *bright, strong, and fast* side. It's like the daytime or when things are energetic and powerful.
- **Yin:** On the other hand, Yin is the *darker, slower, and softer side.* It's like the nighttime or when things are calm and gentle.

But here's the interesting part: Yang and Yin aren’t complete opposites; they actually complement each other.

- **Interconnectedness:** Yang contains a bit of Yin, and Yin contains a bit of Yang. This means even in the brightest of things, there's a small part of darkness, and even in the darkest of things, there's a hint of light.
- **Balance:** They're not fixed. Sometimes something might seem very Yang, but it can also have a bit of Yin in certain situations. It’s about balance and how things change depending on different factors.
- **Working together:** Think of them as partners. Yang starts things, but Yin helps to complete them. Just like how a day starts with light (Yang) and ends with darkness (Yin).

Yin and Yang teach us that nothing is entirely one way or the other; everything has elements of its opposite. They remind us that balance and harmony between seemingly opposite forces are vital for the world to work smoothly.
