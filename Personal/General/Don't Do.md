# Don't Do
1. Avoid overcaring, oversharing, or overexpressing yourself in front of her as it might lead to her losing interest. Create a sense of mystery. [[15-11-2023#^a42a38]]

2. Don't care or overthink about the misunderstanding between us. We will fix it later when we meet. Don't let it ruin your day by dwelling on the drama.

3. Avoid calling, texting, or reaching out to her without a reason repeatedly because she also operates the same way. Keep your efforts consistent. [[19-11-2023#^044d29|19-11-2023]]
4. Refrain from arguing, expressing anger, or letting any emotions surface when talking to her in a bad mood. [[19-11-2023#^8c42c7|19-11-2023]]
