Your weekly usage of Instagram is currently 1 hour and 30 minutes. I've decided to decrease that by under 30 minutes before this year ends. I have 4 weeks remaining to achieve this. I simply won't use Instagram when I'm bored.

I've added an app timer on my phone set for 1 hour every day. It may help me keep track of time and be more mindful of how much time I spend.

## Use wisely

1. **Don't follow unfamiliar people**, including odd friends. If you lack their phone number, what's the purpose of following them? They often suggest your life is dull, but you don't want to feel that way.
2. **Mute individuals** you don't need reminders about their added stories or sent reels. You'll see them later when you're free. They aren't crucial to keep up with.
3. **Implement time controls:** Set a timer for a day, such as 40-50 minutes, or create an [Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fmAiDMSCBeWg9KS8NfYZFicTBaWJuEU8Y2koep8k1gQ/edit?usp=drivesdk) for more accurate monitoring.
