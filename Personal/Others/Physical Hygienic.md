### Shower
1. **Water Temperature:** Use lukewarm water for a comfortable bath. Extreme temperatures, especially very hot water, can dehydrate and potentially be uncomfortable for some people.

2. **Pouring Water on Head:** Avoid extreme temperatures directly on your head. Lukewarm water is generally safer for sensitive skin.

3. **Eating After Bath:** Whether you eat immediately after a bath is a personal preference, not a strict rule.

4. **Direction of Bath:** There's no scientific evidence supporting specific directions for pouring water on the body. Prioritize comfort and avoid extreme temperature changes.
