Her kindness towards everyone is what I love about her. Once upon a time, our group was heading to college, and the roads were under construction. An auto-rickshaw approached us, offering to drop us to our college, as the roads were not ready for any public transport. He requested 20 rupees from Bhupani to Echelon Institute of Technology (our college). Midway, the auto got stuck in a hole, and the driver struggled to get it out. After several attempts, he succeeded. Then, a stranger approached us and suggested taking the Aravali roads, stating they were in better condition ahead. The auto driver turned back, and with eight of us in the auto, she gently pulled me closer, whispering in my ear that we should give him 30 rupees as he was really struggling. I agreed.

Her caring nature, especially in moments like this, where she showed concern for the auto driver's struggle, drew me closer to her.
