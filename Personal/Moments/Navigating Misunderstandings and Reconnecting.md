On the **[[18-11-2023|18th of November 2023]]**, after our math exam, the day took an unexpected turn. While I had plans to unwind and relax for a while on the college grounds after the test, the sudden departure of Anshuman, Nikhil, Pankaj, and Rohit left me feeling unsettled. **Ruchi, Chitransh, and Lakshay** were also prompted to leave, which shifted the mood. Ruchi's reaction was unusual; she began watching *reels loudly without headphones*, and when I requested her to *lower the volume*, it seemed to aggravate her further. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, I chose to move away.

Despite my attempts to communicate non-verbally during our commute home, Ruchi seemed distant. Even as we rode the bus, she sat beside me, engrossed in her reels, occasionally sharing them with me. It seemed she was trying to bridge the gap, but her demeanor remained distant. Curiosity piqued when she updated her bio to "**viva la vida**," a phrase I didn't comprehend. My attempts to understand led to an unintended rift between us,(she said u are irritating) and I decided to maintain silence during the rest of the journey, feeling a sense of disconnect

Later that evening, I reached out to Ruchi via text, hoping to talk and clear the air about the events of the day. Regrettably, our text exchange only led to more confusion and misunderstanding. Upon reflection, the following morning, I realized the need for *patience and empathy* in understanding Ruchi's mood. I called her to express my apologies for not being more understanding and patient. To my surprise, she reciprocated with an apology, acknowledging that her reaction might have been uncalled for.

During our conversation, Ruchi revealed that **Chitransh Verma** had been causing her distress lately, contributing to her unusual behavior and mood swings.

> It was a moment of realization for me; misunderstandings can happen, but it's the effort to bridge the gap that truly matters. Our conversation helped us reconnect and understand each other's perspectives better, ultimately bringing a sense of resolution to our discord.
