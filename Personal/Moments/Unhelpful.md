On [[22-11-2023]], Asad is having a tough time, not as severe, but he has low attendance, and our Semester 3 exams are starting on 2nd Dec. Many students, including Asad, don't have the required 65% attendance (college reduced it to 65%). To address this, the college organized some extra activities to help students increase their attendance.

In our group, only Nikhil and Asad have attendance below 65%, so they're engaging in these activities. Asad participated in various activities like drawing, idea presentations, and solving previous year's exam papers. The previous year's papers carry significant weightage for attendance, so he decided to complete papers for all subjects. However, the deadlines are quite short. He asked, 

"Can you solve any paper, Lakshay?"
I replied, "Yes, I will help you," 

because he needs assistance now. So far, no one has been willing to help Asad, but I suggested asking Ruchi as well.

Ruchi knows Lakshay is helping Asad, although she doesn't like him. She agreed to do one paper for him. I appreciate her kindness, but deep down, I wonder if she has her own motives. Regardless, it's good for Asad. On the other hand, Chitransh Verma outrightly refused to help. I dislike his attitude; he could have helped me, but he doesn't do anything except consuming content on YouTube, Instagram, and Reddit. Even as I write this, he's sending reels.

> He is a consumer, *not a producer*.

While I believe Asad is better than Chitransh in some aspects, Asad is more practical and has clear goals and plans for the future, unlike Chitransh, who goes with the flow.

Today, Asad mentioned that ==Ruchi is more masculine than Chitransh==. *I find this shameful*.
