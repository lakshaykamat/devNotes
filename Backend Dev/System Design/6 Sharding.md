# Sharding
Database sharding is a technique used to distribute a single database across multiple servers to improve scalability and performance. It involves splitting a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces, called shards, each of which can be hosted on a separate database server. Here’s a comprehensive look at database sharding and its implementation:

### What is Database Sharding?

Database sharding is the process of horizontally partitioning data across multiple database instances, so that each instance only holds a subset of the total data. Each partition is referred to as a shard, and together they form the complete dataset.

### Why Use Database Sharding?

1. **Scalability:** Sharding allows you to scale your database horizontally by adding more servers, rather than upgrading a single server.
2. **Performance:** By distributing data across multiple servers, queries can be processed in parallel, reducing response time.
3. **Manageability:** Smaller datasets are easier to manage, back up, and restore.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** If one shard fails, the others can continue to function, improving the overall availability of the system.

### How Sharding Works

1. **Partitioning:** Data is divided into distinct shards based on a sharding key, which determines how data is distributed.
2. **Routing:** Application queries are routed to the appropriate shard based on the sharding key.
3. **Replication (optional):** Shards can be replicated for redundancy and fault tolerance.

### Sharding Strategies

1. **Range Sharding:**
   - Data is partitioned based on ranges of the sharding key.
   - Example: Users with IDs 1-1000 in one shard, 1001-2000 in another.
   - Pros: Simple to implement and understand.
   - Cons: Can lead to uneven data distribution and hotspot issues if data is not uniformly distributed.

2. **Hash Sharding:**
   - Data is distributed based on the hash value of the sharding key.
   - Example: Hash (user_id) % number_of_shards determines the shard.
   - Pros: More uniform data distribution, reducing hotspots.
   - Cons: More complex to implement, and range queries can be challenging.

3. **Geographic Sharding:**
   - Data is partitioned based on geographic regions.
   - Example: Users from North America in one shard, Europe in another.
   - Pros: Reduces latency by keeping data closer to users.
   - Cons: Requires careful planning to handle users who move between regions.

4. **Entity-based Sharding:**
   - Data related to a particular entity is stored in the same shard.
   - Example: All data related to a specific user is stored in the same shard.
   - Pros: Simplifies queries that need to access multiple related data points.
   - Cons: Requires a good understanding of data access patterns.

### Key Considerations in Sharding

1. **Sharding Key Selection:**
   - Choose a key that ensures an even distribution of data and minimizes hotspots.
   - The key should be frequently used in queries to maximize performance benefits.

2. **Rebalancing Shards:**
   - Plan for the need to rebalance shards as data grows or access patterns change.
   - Rebalancing can be complex and may require downtime or sophisticated tooling.

3. **Cross-Shard Joins and Transactions:**
   - Avoid cross-shard joins and transactions if possible, as they can be expensive and slow.
   - If necessary, use techniques like two-phase commits or distributed transactions.

4. **Consistency and Latency:**
   - Ensure that sharding does not compromise data consistency or increase query latency.
   - Implement replication and consistency mechanisms as needed.

5. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuously monitor shard health, performance, and data distribution.
   - Implement automated tools for shard management and maintenance.

### Example: Sharding in JobVault

In the JobVault project, sharding can be used to manage a large and growing dataset of job postings, user data, and applications. Here’s how it might be implemented:

1. **Sharding Key Selection:**
   - Choose a key that ensures even distribution and aligns with access patterns. For job postings, a good candidate might be `job_id` or `company_id`.

2. **Range Sharding Example:**
   - Split job postings into shards based on `job_id` ranges.
   - Shard 1: `job_id` 1-1000
   - Shard 2: `job_id` 1001-2000
   - This approach works if job IDs are evenly distributed and new job postings increment IDs sequentially.

3. **Hash Sharding Example:**
   - Hash `job_id` to determine the shard.
   - Shard = Hash (`job_id`) % number_of_shards
   - Ensures more even distribution of job postings across shards.

4. **Geographic Sharding Example:**
   - Store job postings in shards based on the region.
   - North America Shard, Europe Shard, Asia Shard
   - Reduces latency for users accessing job postings in their region.

### Conclusion

Database sharding is a powerful technique for scaling large databases and improving performance. By carefully selecting a sharding strategy and key, you can ensure efficient data distribution and access. In the JobVault project, sharding can help manage the growing dataset of job postings and user data, ensuring the system remains scalable, performant, and reliable.
