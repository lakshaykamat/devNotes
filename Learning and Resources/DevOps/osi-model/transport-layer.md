## Transport Layer
The transport layer is the fourth layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, responsible for end-to-end communication and ensuring reliable, error-free data transfer between applications on different devices. It manages data segmentation, flow control, error detection, and retransmission, providing a dependable connection for higher-layer protocols.

### Functions of transport layer
1. Segments and reassembles data for efficient transmission.
2. Enables end-to-end communication between applications on different devices.
3. Regulates data flow to prevent congestion and ensure smooth transmission.
4. Implements error detection and retransmission for data integrity.
5. Manages connection establishment, maintenance, and termination.
6. Utilizes port numbers for identifying specific applications or services.
7. Selects the appropriate transport protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP) based on application requirements.
8. Handles multiplexing for simultaneous communication and demultiplexing to direct data to the correct application.
