## Network Layer
The network layer is the third layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, and its primary role is to facilitate communication and data transfer between devices on different networks. It is responsible for logical addressing, routing, and forwarding packets from the source device to the destination device across multiple networks.

### Functions of network layer
1. Assigns logical addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to devices for identification.
2. Determines the optimal path for data packets to travel across multiple networks.
3. Manages the forwarding of packets from source to destination.
4. Utilizes packet-switching for efficient data transmission.
5. Enables communication between devices on different networks (internetworking).
6. Translates logical addresses to physical addresses for actual transmission.
7. Handles errors through detection and correction mechanisms.
8. Fragments and reassembles large packets for efficient transmission.
