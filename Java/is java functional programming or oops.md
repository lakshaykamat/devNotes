**Java as a Functional Programming Language:**

1. **Lambda Expressions:**
   - Java introduced lambda expressions in Java 8, allowing the adoption of a more functional programming style.
   - Lambda expressions enable the creation of anonymous functions, making it easier to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces).

2. **Functional Interfaces:**
   - Java defines functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method.
   - Functional interfaces are used to leverage lambda expressions and functional programming constructs.

3. **Streams API:**
   - The Streams API in Java provides a functional approach to working with collections.
   - It allows operations such as map, filter, and reduce to be applied to sequences of elements in a concise and expressive manner.

4. **Higher-Order Functions:**
   - Java supports the use of higher-order functions, where functions can take other functions as parameters or return functions as results.
   - This is particularly evident in the functional interfaces and lambda expressions.

5. **Immutability:**
   - While not enforced, functional programming encourages immutability.
   - Java supports immutability through the `final` keyword, allowing the creation of immutable classes and objects.

6. **Optional Class:**
   - The `Optional` class, introduced in Java 8, is used to represent an optional value that may or may not be present.
   - It encourages avoiding the use of null and promotes functional-style error handling.

**Java as an Object-Oriented Programming Language:**

1. **Class and Object Concept:**
   - Java is fundamentally built around the concept of classes and objects.
   - Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data and behavior.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation is a key principle of object-oriented programming (OOP), and Java supports it through access modifiers (public, private, protected) and getter and setter methods.
   - It involves bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).

3. **Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass).
   - It supports code reuse, promotes modularity, and facilitates the creation of class hierarchies.

4. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism in Java allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility and extensibility.
   - It includes method overloading and method overriding.

5. **Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors.
   - Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java.

6. **Modularity:**
   - Java's class-based approach supports modularity by organizing code into distinct classes with well-defined responsibilities.
   - Packages are used for additional organization and encapsulation.

7. **Design Patterns:**
   - Java facilitates the implementation of various design patterns, which are reusable solutions to common software design problems.
   - Examples include Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns.

In summary, Java is a versatile language that supports both functional programming and object-oriented programming paradigms. It provides the tools and features to write code in a modular, organized, and expressive manner, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of both programming styles as needed.
