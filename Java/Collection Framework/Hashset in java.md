# HashSet in java
In Java, `HashSet` is a class that implements the `Set` interface in the `java.util` package. 

It is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides an implementation of a set backed by a hash table. Here are some key points about `HashSet`:

1. **No Duplicate Elements:**
   A `HashSet` does not allow duplicate elements. If you attempt to add an element that is already present, the `add` method will return `false`, and the set remains unchanged.

2. **No Order Guarantee:**
   `HashSet` does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The order in which elements are stored may change over time, and it does not provide any order based on the insertion sequence.

3. **Backed by HashMap:**
   Internally, a `HashSet` is backed by a `HashMap` where the elements of the set are the keys, and the values are a constant placeholder (`PRESENT`). This makes operations like `add`, `remove`, and `contains` efficient.

4. **Null Elements:**
   A `HashSet` can store at most one `null` element. If you attempt to add more than one `null`, an `NullPointerException` will be thrown.

5. **Iterating Through Elements:**
   You can iterate through the elements of a `HashSet` using an iterator or the enhanced for loop.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `HashSet`:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a HashSet
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Orange");
        set.add("Apple"); // Duplicate element, will not be added

        // Displaying elements
        System.out.println("HashSet: " + set);

        // Iterating through elements using an iterator
        System.out.println("Iterating through elements:");
        Iterator<String> iterator = set.iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `HashSet` is created, and elements are added to it. The duplicate element "Apple" is not added. The contents of the `HashSet` are then displayed, and an iterator is used to iterate through the elements.
