# Tip
- Initiate problem-solving using the worst complexity brute force approach, noting the pattern-solving question.
- Avoid dedicating an excessive amount of time (30-40 minutes) to a single problem. If stuck, consult hints and solutions, bookmark the question, and revisit it after 10-15 days. If hints are still necessary, review the question again after additional time.
- Consider the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons; a problem marked with thumbs-down may not be ideal to tackle.
